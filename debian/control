Description: EGL External Platform Interface -- development files
 This is a work-in-progress specification of the EGL (Embedded-System
 Graphics Library) External Platform interface for writing EGL platforms and
 their interactions with modern window systems on top of existing low-level
 EGL platform implementations. This keeps window system implementation
 specifics out of EGL drivers by using application-facing EGL functions.
